# Drawboard
Draw anything. Collaborate on ideas. But, together. This application is built using the MERN stack, with MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. This instance is a project demonstration only and not meant for production.
It utilises socket.io for real-time drawing and chat messages, and needlessjs for working with HTML canvases.

# Why tho?
Drawboard is here to help you collaborate with your friends, colleagues, classmates and just about anyone on just about anything from project ideas to organic chemistry to your next business plan. Anyone can create a drawing boardsl Registered users can also manage their drawboards. They can then share the link to the drawing board with other people, who can join and draw together. Chat functionality has been added to make this process easier.
